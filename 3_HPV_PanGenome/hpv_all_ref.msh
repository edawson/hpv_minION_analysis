Usage:

  mash sketch [options] fast(a|q)[.gz] ...

Description:

  Create a sketch file, which is a reduced representation of a sequence or set
  of sequences (based on min-hashes) that can be used for fast distance
  estimations. Input can be fasta or fastq files (gzipped or not), and "-" can
  be given to read from standard input. Input files can also be files of file
  names (see -l). For output, one sketch file will be generated, but it can have
  multiple sketches within it, divided by sequences or files (see -i). By
  default, the output file name will be the first input file with a '.msh'
  extension, or 'stdin.msh' if standard input is used (see -o).

Options:

  Option     Description (range) [default]

  -h         Help

  -p <int>   Parallelism. This many threads will be spawned for processing. [1]

...Input...

  -l         List input. Each file contains a list of sequence files, one per
             line.

...Output...

  -o <path>  Output prefix (first input file used if unspecified). The suffix
             '.msh' will be appended.

...Sketching...

  -k <int>   K-mer size. Hashes will be based on strings of this many
             nucleotides. Canonical nucleotides are used by default (see
             Alphabet options below). (1-32) [21]

  -s <int>   Sketch size. Each sketch will have at most this many non-redundant
             min-hashes. [1000]

  -i         Sketch individual sequences, rather than whole files.

  -w <num>   Probability threshold for warning about low k-mer size. (0-1)
             [0.01]

  -r         Input is a read set. See Reads options below. Incompatible with -i.

...Sketching (reads)...

  -b <size>  Use a Bloom filter of this size (raw bytes or with K/M/G/T) to
             filter out unique k-mers. This is useful if exact filtering with -m
             uses too much memory. However, some unique k-mers may pass
             erroneously, and copies cannot be counted beyond 2. Implies -r.

  -m <int>   Minimum copies of each k-mer required to pass noise filter for
             reads. Implies -r. [1]

  -c <num>   Target coverage. Sketching will conclude if this coverage is
             reached before the end of the input file (estimated by average
             k-mer multiplicity). Implies -r.

  -g <size>  Genome size. If specified, will be used for p-value calculation
             instead of an estimated size from k-mer content. Implies -r.

...Sketching (alphabet)...

  -n         Preserve strand (by default, strand is ignored by using canonical
             DNA k-mers, which are alphabetical minima of forward-reverse
             pairs). Implied if an alphabet is specified with -a or -z.

  -a         Use amino acid alphabet (A-Z, except BJOUXZ). Implies -n, -k 9.

  -z <text>  Alphabet to base hashes on (case ignored by default; see -Z).
             K-mers with other characters will be ignored. Implies -n.

  -Z         Preserve case in k-mers and alphabet (case is ignored by default).
             Sequence letters whose case is not in the current alphabet will be
             skipped when sketching.
